To test GENPPI, we provided folders containing these two genomes. Buchenera is an instant test; It should execute speedily. The Corynebacterium takes a little bit longer to run. However, using the parameter "-expt fixed," we expect no more than one hour to finish the 50 genomes analyzes.
To start a test, change the cursor to one of the folders, using the cd command, and copy the "refer" folder like this:
cp -r refer test1
cp -r refer test2
...
The "-r" should guarantee link preservation during copies, saving your disk space. Pay attention to the fact that offered links are relative to one folder up.
Enjoy it.
